# A-Blockchain-Inspired-Hybrid-Privacy-Preserving-Framework for Accurate Energy Data Management in Smart Cities

Smart cities rely heavily on large-scale energy data collected from smart meters, IoT devices, and distributed energy resources. While this data is crucial for efficient energy management, it raises serious concerns regarding data privacy, security, integrity, and trust.

This project proposes a Blockchain-Inspired Hybrid Privacy-Preserving Framework that ensures secure, private, and accurate energy data management while maintaining system scalability and performance.

The framework integrates blockchain principles, cryptographic privacy techniques, and hybrid data management strategies to protect sensitive energy consumption data without compromising analytical accuracy.
